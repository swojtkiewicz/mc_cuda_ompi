#MPI hosts

#please do not edit this file unless you know what you are doing!

#"localhost slots=1 max-slots=1" - this is the master/root MPI processor, if you do not have CUDA enabled GPU cards on the localhost machine
#If you have CUDA enabled GPU cards on the localhost machine and you want to use them in the simulation process, please set the "slots" and "max-slots"
# to number of GPU cards on the machine + 1. E.g. you have 2 GPU cards(processors) and you want to use just one of them:"localhost slots=2 max-slots=2"  

localhost slots=4 max-slots=4
#localhost slots=2 max-slots=2

#Now, we have to declare a list of machines names (or IP address), wher "slots" and "max-slots" are equal to the number of CUDA enabled GPU cards on the machine
#E.g. we have a PC with DNS name "posejdon", IP address 192.168.1.12 and 3 GPU cards, each card has 1 graphical processors:
#"posejdon  slots=3 max-slots=3" or "192.168.1.12  slots=3 max-slots=3"

#zeus slots=4 max-slots=4
#posejdon  slots=3 max-slots=3
